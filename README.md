# Name of the Game - Party Games App 🪩🕺🤠

## About the App
**Our goal is:** provide a website to users that allows them to play party games for free with our offline compatible and internationalized PWA 🏁

**However:** Because this is a spare-time project of ours, there isn't a guarantee for its availability, quality, or accessibility, even though we try to pay attention to it.
