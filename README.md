## About the App
**Our goal is to:** provide a website to users that allows them to play party games for free with our offline compatible and internationalized PWA 🏁

[👉 **Give it a try!** 👈](https://name-of-the-game.stephanhagmann.ch/)

**However:** Because this is a spare-time project of ours, there isn't a guarantee for its availability, quality, or accessibility, even though we try to pay attention to it.

## Sustainability 🌱
Our App is hosted on a CO₂-negative server by Swiss hosting provider [Informaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com).

These logs are securely stored on Swiss servers provided by [Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com) and are **never shared**.
