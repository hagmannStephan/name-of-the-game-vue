# Name of the Game - Party Games App

## About the App
**Our goal is:** provide a website to users that allows them to play party games for free with our offline compatible and internationalized PWA!

**However:** Because this is a spare-time project of ours, there isn't a guarantee for its availability, quality, or accessibility, even though we try to pay attention to it.

## About us
This is a project created for educational purposes by:
- Joan (known as [JDL](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5NUcHZ9WWGFL1slBTeWWpx?si=aX2LGYXTRryYuzFu87Gu0Q), responsible for sound design)
- Liam (responsible for design)
- Stephan (responsible for hosting and functionality)

## Sustainability
Our App is hosted on a COâ‚‚-negative server from the Swiss hosting provider [Informaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/de).
