# V1
I want to implement the following modes for the V1:
- Pantomime
- Draw
- Describe (without saying the word or similar words)

I already looked at some APIs and I liked these ones:
- https://www.datamuse.com/api/ -> Get words, synonyms, words that are used to describe the word, etc.
- https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys -> Translate from one language to another
